I ran my code against Rikki Gibson's, and while I found no differences on the seed of 42, there were many differences on the seed of 1. It took me quite a while to figure out what had gone wrong, and I'm still not quite sure. Essntially, the implementation of our 'garden' cards differ. It is very very difficult to determine who is correct - as difficult as writing the code in the first place, honestly. While differential testing is great for coverage - I hit 60% coverage in only 4 runs, it's pretty terrible for situations like this. The main problem is that we don't have an actual working, completely correct implementation of dominion to test against, which makes what we are doing very much like shooting in the dark. Who knows what we're likely to hit. Coverage of the card implementations was at almost 100%, while some of the win conditions were harder to hit via truly random testing - the way I wrote my tester, it seems that ending the game due to a lack of province cards was highly unlikely.
